			    							<p>
			    								Fremont Brewing's current navigation provides links to almost every page within their site. For a static informational website, this can be overwhelming to a user as it provides them with too many options. 
			    								<br><br>
			    								The current site houses at least 25 pages, reachable from the main and secondary navigation in the header. Adjusting the way the site is structured so only primary links are included in the header will help guide the user through the site and lessen the chance that the user will bounce from the site because they can't easily find what they're looking for. Ideally, with a longer timeline, I would have preferred to do user research and usability testing to dive deep into the best way to build out the sites full architecture. However, for the purposes of this course, we worked on 2 distinct page levels and focused on the visual changes.

												Based on our expedited project timeline, I performed a quick audit of a few competitor's websites to determine what data is important and how they're displaying it.

													Beers on Tap, Location(s), Keg Details, Beers To Go

You get a sense from reading through the content that they want everyone to come join them for a beer. I want to continue to portray this in the redesigned site, while also bringing this personality out in the visual elements.

	    							<div class="col-lg-8 mb-30">
	    								My primary goal when starting work on the visual designs was to tell the story of the interactions on the homepage. My intention is for the homepage to be scroll jacked and for each content section to take over the height of the screen. To show this in a static visual, I created a separate mock for each section with the carousel indicators on the left displaying the correctly selected icon.
	    								<br><br>
										From the wireframes, I kept the approach that each section would only provide 'teaser' information. This helps organize the site without overloading the main navigation. It also helps the user easily identify the information they are seeking and navigate to their final destination with ease.
										<br><br>
										I chose a colorful palette that utilizes the tones of their former logo but adds a bit more sophistication to their pages. This palette stays true to their brand and personality with vibrant yellows and blues but is balanced out by the darker pastel green and slate gray to help portray a seasoned company.
										<br><br>
										I opted to use their slim horizontal logo in the header to save some page real estate and have thought about incorporating the larger heron logo on a loading or age verification screen instead.
										<br><br>
										I chose a san serif typeface for the headers that is playful and modern and paired it with a more traditional serif typeface to tie everything back to their logo and personality.
										<br><br>
										All secondary pages will utilize the original browser scroll so as not to be too frustrating to their users. I keeps the layout grounded to the homepage by bringing the color blocks back in to break up each section. I use bold headers to help guide the eye around the page so users knew exactly where to look to find the information they were seeking.

	    								Fremont Brewing is such an iconic part of Seattle's beer history and I wanted their website to stand out as much as they do as a brewery. I wanted to provide them with something fun and something quirky, but also something sophisticated. While they play the fun, quirky, welcoming card really well (and it's something we Seattleites know and love about them), this tends to play down the level of craft they put into each beer they make. They are well regarded in the beer community and toning down some of their original shades and using a nice traditional serif for their main text brings in a level of sophistication back into the site.
	    								<br><br>
										Rethinking the flow of the site is something that will make the biggest impact. Their current navigation system is overwhelming and with a little restructuring we can ease some of the anxiety a user might face when trying to figure out what they should click on to find the information they're really after.

	    								I struggled a lot with this color palette. My personal style leans quite neutral or mostly neutral with a pop of color, so working with an overly colorful palette was a challenge. I had a hard time visualizing the end result and ended up needing to make some adjustments between the wireframe phase and visual design phase because my original ideas and designs worked better for a more neutral palette with occasional pops of color.
	    								<br><br>
										I also struggled to distance myself from my technical background. My first attempt at a mood board ended up being more of a style tile because I approached it from a technical viewpoint. I dove head first into choosing fonts and icon sets because that's what I'm familiar with. After feedback from the class I really had to take a step back and try to see this portion of the project from a more abstract viewpoint. I found out that I really liked it and was more pleased with my second attempt than my first.

			    						With a longer timeline and more resources, I would have preferred to do some usability testing on their current site and really dive deep into the nitty gritty of their user's actions.

						    			<br><br>
										There is a lot of information that is, clearly, important to their stakeholders, but likely not as important to the masses, and as such, we wouldn't want to put focus on those areas. Figuring out the main needs of their users would make all the difference in understanding the best flow for their site.
