									<h3>Randy</h3>
	    							<p>
	    								Randy is a 33 year old trucker who just learned that his company is requiring him to get a DOT Physical. He checks the MinuteClinic website sees that they're open for another 40 minutes. When he gets there he's turned away and told to make an appointment for tomorrow. Randy doesn't understand why he needs to make an appointment when the provider is on duty and there is no one in the queue.
	    								<br><br>
	    								DOT Physicals are 90 minute appointments, so Randy would never have been able to be seen that close to their closing time. Had he gone in for a flu shot, he would not have been turned away, but the website doesn't currently communicate visit length time.

	    							<h3>Suzie</h3>
		    						<p>
		    							Suzie is a 28 year old single mother of a rambunctious 6 year old. Her daughter, Lauren, has spent the last 3 days fighting flu-like symptoms and seems to be getting worse. Suzie takes the day off from work to take Lauren to the clinic. She looks up the closest MinuteClinic near her and sees that the wait time is only 32 minutes. Suzie decides to hold her place in line using the websites "Visit today" feature to make sure her and her daughter are seen in a timely manner. They arrives at the clinic 10 minutes later, check in, and sit down in the waiting area. Suzie and her daughter wait for 45 minutes until she finally finds the provider and asks how much longer the wait will be. The provider tells Suzie that there are 2 more people in line ahead of her. They frustratingly waits another 30 minutes before being seen.
		    							<br><br>
		    							Suzie's wait time at the clinic ended up being 43 minutes longer than the website's approximate wait time listed. It is a known issue that the approximate wait time is not always accurate.

	    					<h3>Research Readout</h3>
	    					<p class="sm-text mb-20">Led by CVS's UX team</p>
	    					<p>
	    						Back in October 2018, the CVS UX team performed Usability testing on their current locator.
	    						This included 10 remote sessions, 30 minutes each, where they tested the locator and clinic details pages.
	    					</p>

	    					<h4>Key Findings</h4>
	    					<ol>
	    						<li>Users interacted with the list more than the map</li>
	    						<li>Users failed to notice the Insurance filter, but when asked about the importance of insurance and cost, they said it was very important</li>
	    						<li>Many users said an "Open Now" message would be helpful</li>
	    						<li>Clinic Details - Current hours format is well understood, but those that convert (go to a clinic) find that the posted hours lead to a frustrating experience and are sometimes incorrect</li>
	    						<li>Clinic Details - Users were looking for a list of Services</li>
	    						<li>Clinic Details - Users were expecting a map view at the top of the clinic details page</li>
	    					</ol>
	    					<hr>

	    					<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
	    					<p>
	    						Before beginning on wireframes, I visited competitors' websites and noticed the majority were emphasizing <em>scheduling over walk-ins</em>, as well as keeping the pages as simple as possible with <em>limited messaging and uncomplicated language</em>. None of them communicated an approximate wait time.
	    					</p>
	    					<hr>

	    					<h3>Constraints</h3>
	    					<h4>Vendor Requirements</h4>
	    					<p>
	    						We recieved a document listing 20 vendor requirements for this phase of our project, which were in addition to the 19 other vendor requirements we had for the first phase of our project.
	    						<br><br>
	    						<em>Example Requirements</em><br>
	    						<ol>
	    							<li>Needs to show provider on duty</li>
	    							<li>Add additional filtering options</li>
	    							<li>Ability to sort by distance and wait time</li>
	    							<li>Needs to improve communication of Wait time to users (For example: How do we communicate it in a way that says if a clinic is busy without stating actual wait time?)</li>
	    							<li>Needs to improve display of temporary clinic closure (Full Day/Partial) and holiday messaging</li>
	    						</ol>
	    					</p>

	    					<h4>Branding & Design System</h4>
	    					<p>
	    						The CVS team provided us with access to their Brand Center website where we were able to collect and download UI Kits, icon guidelines, branding guidelines, etc. This allowed me to know what design limitations I was working within and what common design patterns looked like for them.

	    				<div class="project-section">
	    					<h2 id="ideation">Ideation & Design Iterations</h2>
	    					
	    					<h3>Initial Ideas to Test</h3>
	    					<ul>
	    						<li>- Number of patients in line vs approximate wait time</li>
	    						<li>- "Disabled" text in place of "missing" buttons in the result card</li>
	    						<li>- Horizontal search bar with filtering options and 1 search feature instead of 2</li>
	    						<li>- Addition of a browse path & SEO content block for improved SEO and link equity</li>
	    						<li>- Change button text - move away from 2 "visit" buttons</li>
	    						<li>- Slim hero banner to help orient the user and align with other site layouts</li>
	    						<li>- Approach: simple & uncluttered</li>
	    					</ul>

	    					<h4>Key Feedback</h4>
	    					<ul>
	    						<li>Want to display wait time</li>
	    						<li>Avoid tooltips</li>
	    						<li>Holiday Hours Treatment: think about combining into one view</li>
	    						<li>Add # of services to the Services header</li>

	    					<p>
	    						CVS's UX team compiled their notes from the first round of usability testing and shared with us in a readout and presentation. They also provided links to each usability test.

	    					<h3>Goals</h3>
	    					<ul>
	    						<li>Evaluate redesigns for clinic locator and clinic details pages</li>
								<li>Explore new approaches to communicating wait time and clinic availability</li>
								<li>Solicit user feedback on various design approaches and feature enhancements</li>

							<h3>Methods</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>9 total moderated remote tests via Usertesting.com</li>
								<li>Each participant interacted with designs from both CVS and RIO</li>
								<li>The order of design exposure alternated every session to reduce bias</li>
								<li>Participants explore the designs, completed specific tasks, and provided overall and detailed feedback</li>

	    						<li>Rio SEO - Users were easily able to find the filters</li>

	    					<h3>Challenges</h3>
	    					<p>
	    						Being an external partner on this project had it's limitations. We don't have as holistic of an understanding about their challenges beyond the brief meetings about the subject. We didn't always have quick access to the appropriate resources. And their internal teams have a better understanding of how and where they can push the boundaries of their business rules and design systems.
	    					</p>
	    					<p class="mt-12">
	    						Rio SEO doesn't typicaly work within as extensive of a UX process like this, so our timeline was not updated to reflect the additional steps so we worked through each step in the process much quicker than we should have. Something CVS typically takes months to complete, we did in 2 weeks. Had we had some extra time, I think we could have been able to be in stronger alignment on the project.
	    					</p>
	    					<p class="mt-12">
	    						I've learned that usertesting.com is not always the best way to do usability testing. I believe actual customer feedback & online reviews should play a role in the decision making process as well.
	    					</p>

	    					<h3>In Conclusion</h3>
	    					<p>
	    						This project allowed me to work with a very talented UX team whose end goal is the same as mine; simplify the messaging and alleviate confusion for their users about when they can come in to a clinic. I'm proud of the work we've come up with as a team and believe our blended ideas will serve the user well.
