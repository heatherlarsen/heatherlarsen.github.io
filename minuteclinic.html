									<h3>Randy</h3>
	    							<p>
										Randy, a 33 year old trucker, recently learned that his company is requiring him to get a DOT Physical. 
										He checks the MinuteClinic website and sees that they're open for another 40 minutes. 
										When he gets there he's turned away and told to make an appointment for tomorrow. 
										Randy is frustrated he can't be seen when the provider is on duty and there is no one in the queue.
	    								<br><br>
										What Randy didn't know is that DOT Physicals are 90 minute appointments, so it's unlikely he'd be seen at any clinic that close to closing time. 
										Had he gone in for a flu shot, he wouldn't have been turned away, but the website doesn't currently communicate visit length time.

		    						<p>
										Suzie is a 28 year old single mother of a rambunctious 6 year old. 
										Her daughter, Lauren, has spent the last 3 days fighting flu-like symptoms
										that are getting worse. She takes the day off work to take Lauren to the clinic
										and sees that the nearest MinuteClinic location has a wait time of 32 minutes.
										Suzie holds her place in line using the website's "Visit today" feature. They arrive 
										at the clinic 10 minutes later, check in, and sit down in the waiting area. 
										Suzie and her daughter wait for 45 minutes until she finds the provider and asks
										how much longer the wait will be. The provider tells Suzie there are 2 more people
										in line ahead of her. They wait another 30 minutes before being seen. Suzie's wait time 
										at the clinic ended up being 43 minutes longer than the website's approximate wait time listed.

	    					<h3>Research Readout</h3>
	    					<p class="sm-text mb-20">Led by CVS's UX team</p>
	    					<p>
	    						In October 2018, the CVS UX team performed usability testing on their previous locator website.
							</p>
							<h4>Sessions</h4>
							10 virtual 30 minute sessions testing the locator and the clinic details page

	    					<h4>Key Findings</h4>
	    					<ol>
								<li>More interaction with the list than the map</li>
								<li>Insurance filter was not obvious</li>
								<li>Insurance and cost of services listed as "very important"</li>
								<li>Lack of "Open Now" feature</li>
	    						<li>Current hours format was well understood</li>
								<li>Posted hours and wait times can be incorrect leading to frustration in the clinic</li>
								<li>Missing a list of available services</li>
	    						<li>Expected a map view near the top of the clinic details page</li>
	    					</ol>
	    					<hr>

	    					<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
	    					<p>
								Before beginning on wireframes, I performed a competitive analysis and found that the majority of their competitors' websites
								emphasized <strong>scheduling over walk-ins</strong>, <strong>limited messaging</strong>, and <strong>used plain language</strong>. 
								None of them communited an approximate wait time.
	    					</p>
	    					<hr>

	    					<h3>Constraints</h3>
	    					<h4>Vendor Requirements</h4>
	    					<p>
								We recieved a document including 20 vendor requirements for the redesign, 
								which added to the 19 previous requirements we obtained after the client signed with Rio SEO.
	    						<br><br>
	    						<em>Example Requirements</em><br>
	    						<ol>
	    							<li>Needs to show provider on duty</li>
	    							<li>Add additional filtering options</li>
	    							<li>Ability to sort by distance and wait time</li>
	    							<li>
										Needs to improve communication of Wait time to users 
										(ie. How do we communicate wait time in a way that says the clinic is busy without providing an exact number?)
									</li>
	    							<li>Needs to improve display of temporary clinic closure (Full Day/Partial) and holiday messaging</li>
	    						</ol>
	    					</p>

	    					<h4>Branding & Design System</h4>
	    					<p>
								The CVS team provided us with access to their Brand Center where we were able to collect and download UI Kits, 
								icon guidelines, branding guidelines, etc. This allowed us to know what design limitations we were working within 
								and what common design patterns looked like for the CVS team.

	    					<ol>
	    						<li>Number of patients in line vs approximate wait time</li>
	    						<li>"Disabled" text in place of "missing" buttons in the result card</li>
	    						<li>Horizontal search bar with filtering options and 1 search feature instead of 2</li>
	    						<li>Addition of a browse path & SEO content block for improved SEO and link equity</li>
	    						<li>Change button text - move away from using "visit" in nearby buttons</li>
	    						<li>Slim hero banner to help orient the user and align with other site layouts</li>
	    						<li>Visual approach: simple & uncluttered</li>

	    					<h3>Goals</h3>
	    					<ul>
	    						<li>Evaluate both versions of the redesign for the locator and the clinic details pages</li>
								<li>Explore new approaches to communicating wait time and clinic availability</li>
								<li>Solicit user feedback on various design approaches and feature enhancements</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Methods</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>9 total moderated remote tests via Usertesting.com</li>
								<li>Each participant interacted with both designs</li>
								<li>The order of design exposure alternated every session to reduce bias</li>
								<li>Participants explored the designs, completed specific tasks, and provided general and detailed feedback</li>

							<h3>Participants</h3>

								Overall users found the Rio SEO designs easy to navigate, but preferred the CVS designs overall. 
								As such, the CVS UX team worked through iterations on those designs internally and 
								once finalized they provided them to the Rio SEO development team for implementation.

								Shortly after the usability tests wrapped up, I moved on to a new role outside of Rio SEO and was unable to see this project through to launch.

	    					<h3>Challenges</h3>
	    					<p>
								Working as an external vendor can be challenging as we are not as in-tune 
								with the inner workings of CVS's procedures. We found it challenging
								to receive small snapshots of prior research, to not always have timely access to the necessary design resources,
								and to have a lesser understanding of when and where we could push the boundaries of their business rules and design system. 
	    					</p>
	    					<p class="mt-12">
								Additionally, CVS typically takes months to complete the process the Rio SEO team had to consolidate into 2 weeks.
								With a more appropriate timeline on the Rio SEO side, we may have had more time to align on project goals and work through the challenges listed above.
	    					</p>
	    					<p class="mt-12">
								Personally, I feel real customer feedback and online reviews should be weighted more heavily than 
								usability tests with those not as acquainted with the challenges of going from the digital platform to an in-clinic experience, 
								as a lot of the challenges their users are facing stem from that experience.
	    					</p>

	    					<h3>In Conclusion</h3>
	    					<p>
								This project allowed me to work with a very talented UX team with the same end goal as my own; 
								simplify the messaging and alleviate confusion for their users about 
								when they can come in to a clinic. I'm proud of the process we worked through as a 
								team and hope our blended ideas will serve the user well and that the CVS team will continue to iterate on these pages.
