	    									<p>
	    										The following project was completed as part of the Visual Design for UX course. The prompt was to redesign one of 3 local company websites: Fremont Brewing, Salt & Straw, or Top Pot.
	    										<br><br>
	    										We were asked to take into account the company's personality and consider ways to improve upon their site's information architecture.

			    							<h4>Site Audit</h4>
			    							<p>
			    								Fremont Brewing's current navigation provides links to almost every page within their site. For a static informational website, this can be overwhelming to a user as it provides them with too many options. 
			    								<br><br>
			    								The current site houses at least 25 pages, reachable from the main and secondary navigation in the header. Adjusting the way the site is structured so only primary links are included in the header will help guide the user through the site and lessen the chance that the user will bounce from the site because they can't easily find what they're looking for. Ideally, with a longer timeline, I would have preferred to do user research and usability testing to dive deep into the best way to build out the sites full architecture. However, for the purposes of this course, we worked on 2 distinct page levels and focused on the visual changes.

			    							<p>
												Based on our expedited project timeline, I performed a quick audit of a few competitor's websites to determine what data is important and how they're displaying it.
												<br><br>
												I gathered that the importance is often placed on the following details:
												<p class="mt-10 emphasize">
													Beers on Tap, Location(s), Keg Details, Beers To Go
												</p>

			    							<h4>Brand Personality</h4>
			    							<p>
			    								One of the things that I love about Fremont Brewing's current website is how they convey their personality through the copy. They are funny and no bullshit, but also very welcoming. You get a sense from reading through the content that they want everyone to come join them for a beer. I want to continue to portray this in the redesigned site, while also bringing this personality out in the visual elements.

	    								<p>
	    									I approached the initial mood board from more of a technical view and ended up creating more of a style tile, which can be seen above. After feedback from the class, I adjusted the approach that I took and created a more traditional mood board. I revised the color scheme that I initially chose because I realized we didn't need to stick to the client's original color scheme and I wanted to provide them with a slightly more sophisticated palette.
