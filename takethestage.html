	    									<p>
	    										The following project was completed in 6 weeks as part of the User Experience Design Circuit. We were given 4 project options; a travel app, a personal connections app for family and friends located in different geographical boundaries, a connected home app, or a "create your own topic" project. 
	    										<br><br>
												I chose to create my own topic because I'd had an app idea in mind that I was interested in pursuing. In short, that idea started as a way for users to find set times for concerts. It evolved into much more than that.

They want to be able to plan drinks/dinner or other life events around the scheduled concert and want to make sure they're taking proper transportation to get to the venue on time. They also don't want to miss their favorite band due to scheduling conflicts.

			    						<h4>About the app</h4>
					    				<p>
					    					After completing the design process, comparing the competitor apps, and revisiting the research, Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that the real issue lies in the data. If I move forward with this project, I would pivot and start researching a solution for data management. I would keep working on the user facing system, as there still seem to be needs there, but I would consider creating a user interface where venues can input and store their data that can then be used as a source of truth for other apps and services.

			    					</div>
			    					<div class="col-lg-6">
			    						<h4>About the Process</h4>
					    				<p>
					    					The biggest lesson is that the idea you have in your head at the start of the process is not always the product youâ€™ll come out with in the end. At the beginning my idea was a simple app to display concert set times, as this is the one aspect I feel is really lacking in concert tracking apps today. But after going through the research process, I realized the problem was much larger than that. Users wanted a better concert tracking app, in general. More reliable information, less back and forth between apps, and simpler interfaces.
					    					<br><br>
											I also learned to take better notes when rewatching or re-listening to the recorded interviews. I must have gone through each of them at least 3 or 4 times to try to squeeze new information out of them during the process.
