	    					<ol>
								<li>Identify behaviors when preparing for a show</li>
								<li>Gauge interest in set time information and how that information could affect their planning</li>
							</ol>

	    					<hr>

	    					<h3>Target Audience</h3>
	    					<p>
	    						Individuals between 21 & 35 years of age who regularly attend concerts or have attended a concert within the last 6 months
	    					</p>
	    					<hr>

	    					<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
	    					<p>
	    						Concert enthusiasts don't want to stand around a venue waiting for 'their' performer to take the stage. They want to be able to plan drinks/dinner or other life events around the scheduled concert and want to make sure they're taking proper transportation to get to the venue on time. They also don't want to miss their favorite band due to scheduling conflicts.
	    					</p>
	    					<hr>

	    					<h3>User Interview Takeaways</h3>
	    					<p class="sm-text mb-20">3 people, ages 24-30</p>
							<ol>
								<li>There is often an uncertainty between the door open time and show start time</li>
								<li>Users prefer to wait at a nearby bar or restaurant instead of standing around before a show</li>
								<li>Users want to know who is playing and what time they are playing</li>
								<li>Users want an easy way listen to artists and to purchase tickets</li>
								<li><strong>Users don’t enjoy cross-referencing apps to get all the details</strong></li>
							</ol>

	    					<h3>User Flow</h3>
	    					<p>
	    						Initially I created a complex user flow chart that went through all the various paths a user could take. After reviewing it with my mentor, it made more sense to break each path up into it's own user flow. Below you can see 3 of the potential paths a user can take. 
	    					</p>

	    					<h4>Registration Path</h4>
	    					<div class="flow-flex">
		    					<a href="assets/images/projects/takethestage/user-flow/register-flow.png" class="js-ga" data-fancybox="takethestage" data-caption="" data-ga="Take the Stage, Register Flow">
									<img src="assets/images/projects/takethestage/user-flow/register-flow.png" class="image-path">
								</a>

								<p>
									This is the path a new user would take when deciding to register for the app. Once they provide valid registration details, they are asked if they want to sync with a music service of their choice (ie: Spotify). If they decide to sync, they will be directed to their feed populated with the artists they follow on said music service. If they opt out of sync, they will be directed to the geolocation based search page, which would be populated with concerts near them.
								</p>
							</div>
							<hr>

							<h4>Guest - Ticket Purchase Path</h4>
							<div class="flow-flex">
								<a href="assets/images/projects/takethestage/user-flow/guest-buy.png" class="js-ga" data-fancybox="takethestage" data-caption="" data-ga="Take the Stage, Guest Buy Flow">
									<img src="assets/images/projects/takethestage/user-flow/guest-buy.png" class="image-path">
								</a>

								<p>
									This is the path a user would take if they've opted not to register for the app, but still want to purchase tickets for a concert. They would search for an artist or location and see a list of results. Once they select a concert, they'll be provided with more details and be able to purchase tickets. Once they click the purchase tickets button they will be directed to the 3rd party ticket vendor for said concert.
								</p>
							</div>
							<hr>

							<h4>Logged In - User Interested in Concert</h4>
							<div class="flow-flex">
								<a href="assets/images/projects/takethestage/user-flow/user-interested.png" class="js-ga" data-fancybox="takethestage" data-caption="" data-ga="Take the Stage, User Interested Flow">
									<img src="assets/images/projects/takethestage/user-flow/user-interested.png" class="image-path">
								</a>

								<p>
									This is the path a registered user would take if they want to mark themselves as "interested" in attending a concert. First they would need to be signed in. Once signed in, they would be directed to their feed populated with the artists they are currently following. If they see a concert they want to attend, they can click on that concert to be provided with details. Once on the details page, they can check "Interested" or "Going" and the view would update. This would also update their profile and calendar so they can easily navigate back to that concert at a later date.

	    					<h3>What I learned</h3>
	    					<h4>About the App</h4>
	    					<p>
	    						After completing the design process, comparing the competitor apps, and revisiting the research, I’ve come to the conclusion that the real issue lies in the data. If I move forward with this project, I would pivot and start researching a solution for data management. I would keep working on the user facing system, as there still seem to be needs there, but I would consider creating a user interface where venues can input and store their data that can then be used as a source of truth for other apps and services.
	    					</p>

	    					<h4>About the Process</h4>
	    					<p>
	    						The biggest lesson is that the idea you have in your head at the start of the process is not always the product you’ll come out with in the end. At the beginning my idea was a simple app to display concert set times, as this is the one aspect I feel is really lacking in concert tracking apps today. But after going through the research process, I realized the problem was much larger than that. Users wanted a better concert tracking app, in general. More reliable information, less back and forth between apps, and simpler interfaces.
	    						<br><br>
	    						I also learned to take better notes when rewatching or re-listening to the recorded interviews. I must have gone through each of them at least 3 or 4 times to try to squeeze new information out of them during the process.
